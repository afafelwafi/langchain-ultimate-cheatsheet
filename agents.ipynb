    "In LangChain, the AgentType enum helps you specify what kind of agent you want to use when calling **initialize_agent()**. Each type reflects a different agent architecture or control flow logic for how the LLM should handle a task, especially when tools are involved. Agent Types that are most commonly used:\n",
    "- ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION\n",
    "    - Based on the ReAct framework (Reasoning + Acting).\n",
    "    - The LLM chooses tools based on their descriptions.\n",
    "    - Tools are described in plain text and selected via text reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Good for: Flexible reasoning tasks, basic tool usage, general-purpose agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- REACT_DOCSTORE\n",
    "    - Specialized version of ReAct for document retrieval from a docstore.\n",
    "    - Now considered more niche or legacy.\n",
    "      \n",
    "✅ Good for: Document lookup use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SELF_ASK_WITH_SEARCH\n",
    "    - Uses self-questioning decomposition.\n",
    "    - The agent breaks a query into sub-questions and uses external search to find answers.\n",
    "    - Based on a research paper by Microsoft.\n",
    "      \n",
    "✅ Good for: Multi-hop Q&A, research-style queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION\n",
    "    - Like ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, but optimized for chat-based models.\n",
    "    - Uses role-based prompts (system/user) better suited for APIs like OpenAI Chat.\n",
    "      \n",
    "✅ Good for: GPT-style chat models using tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OPENAI_FUNCTIONS\n",
    "    - Uses OpenAI’s function calling API (or similar APIs like Claude's Tool Use).\n",
    "    - Tools are invoked using structured JSON schema definitions, not text parsing.\n",
    "    - Model selects tools by function name directly.\n",
    "      \n",
    "✅ Good for: OpenAI/Claude models with function-calling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION\n",
    "    - A conversational version of the chat ReAct agent.\n",
    "    - Maintains memory between turns via LangChain memory components.\n",
    "      \n",
    "✅ Good for: Virtual assistants, stateful chat agents.\n"
