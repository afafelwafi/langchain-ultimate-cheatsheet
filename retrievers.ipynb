    "# Retrievers\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrievers are components that handle the process of searching and retrieving relevant documents or data based on a query. They are used to find the most relevant pieces of information (e.g., documents, embeddings) from a large collection or knowledge base in response to a user‚Äôs query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "- Retrieval Process: A retriever typically performs similarity search or other retrieval strategies to find documents that are most relevant to the query.\n",
    "- Integration with Vector Stores: Retrievers often interact with vector stores (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS) to perform efficient similarity searches by comparing the query vector to stored vectors."
